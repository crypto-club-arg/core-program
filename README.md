- **Objective:** To train and empower the next generation of ZK experts.
- **Duration:** **6 intensive weeks.**
- **Cost:** **Free**, thanks to the ZK Education Team of the Ethereum Foundation.

## Learning Content (6-Week Weekly Syllabus)

### Week 1: Fundamentals and Open Source Culture
- **Prerequisites:** Necessary prior knowledge for the course.
- **Open Source Culture:** Introduction and reinforcement of the importance and practices of open-source code.

### Week 2: Classical and Modern Cryptography & Introduction to ZKPs
- **Cryptography:** Classical and modern (From symmetric to asymmetric ciphers: RSA, Diffie-Hellman).
- **Introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** What they are and why they are necessary (Scalability and Privacy). Types of ZK-Proofs: zk-SNARKs vs zk-STARKs.
- **Technologies:** Introduction to Circom.

### Week 3: More Crypto, SNARKs, and STARKs
- **Study:** KZG Polynomial Commitments, Trusted Setup.
- **STARKs and SNARKs:** Definition, characteristics, and uses.
- **Practical Application:** Algorithm implementation and basic ZKP demonstrations.
- **Technologies:** Advanced Circom & Introduction to Cairo
  
### Week 4: PLONK
- **Study:**
    - **PLONK Introduction:** Vitalik's blog post, Plonkish circuit arithmetization.
    - **Implementation:** Explore Plonkathon reference implementation.
    - **Core Concepts:** Brief understanding of underlying mathematical tools (e.g., polynomial commitments)
- **Technologies:** Introduction to Noir

### Week 5: ZK-ET Workshop
