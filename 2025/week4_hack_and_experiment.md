# Week 3 - Hack and Experiment

## üìú Guiding Principles

**Code for Impact**: Your code doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be a functional prototype that is presentable and runnable. Focus on a core idea that can have a real-world impact.

**Collaborate and Learn**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use existing libraries and tools to accelerate your development. This is a learning experience, so don't be afraid to ask for help, but always try to solve problems on your own first.

**Communicate Your Vision**: Be prepared to present your project clearly and concisely. Explain the problem you are solving, how your solution works, and the potential impact it can have. Your ability to communicate your vision is as important as your code.

## üí° Hackathon Tracks & Project Wishlist

We've designed several tracks to inspire your creativity. Here are some ideas to get you started:

### Track 1: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for Inclusion üí∏

**The Challenge**: A significant portion of Argentina's population, particularly in rural areas and among vulnerable groups, remains unbanked or excluded from formal financial services. How can we build more inclusive and private financial systems?

- **Private Microlending**: Design a ZK-powered platform that allows individuals to prove their creditworthiness (e.g., consistent rent payments, utility bills) without revealing their entire financial history, enabling access to microloans.

- **Anonymous Savings Pools ("Cajas de Ahorro")**: Create a digital version of traditional community savings pools. Members can prove they've made their contributions without revealing their identity or total savings, enhancing trust and security.

### Track 2: Digital Identity & Reputation üõ°Ô∏è

**The Challenge**: Argentina has faced significant challenges with the security and privacy of its digital identity systems (e.g., DNI digital, government databases), leading to data breaches and a lack of public trust. How can we empower citizens with more control over their personal data?

- **Self-Sovereign Digital ID**: Build a ZK-based digital identity system that allows users to selectively disclose information about themselves (e.g., proving they are over 18 for online services without revealing their exact date of birth or DNI number).

- **Private Professional Credentials**: Create a platform where professionals can prove their qualifications (e.g., university degrees from CONEAU-recognized institutions, certifications) without revealing their full identity, combating fraud and protecting privacy.

- **Reputation System for the Informal Economy**: Develop a system that allows workers in the informal economy (artisans, delivery workers, freelance professionals) to build a verifiable reputation based on their skills and reliability, without a centralized authority.

### Track 3: Public Goods & Transparent Supply Chains üç∑ü•©üåΩ

**The Challenge**: Ensuring the transparency and fairness of Argentina's key export supply chains (wine, beef, soybeans, grains) and public services is a major challenge. How can we bring more trust and accountability?

- **Fair-Trade Beef & Wine Tracker**: Build a ZK-powered system that allows consumers to scan a QR code on a product and verify that it was sourced ethically and sustainably, without revealing sensitive business data of small producers.

- **"Miner√≠a Responsable" Certification**: Design a platform that uses ZKPs to certify that lithium or gold was extracted without forced labor or environmental damage, enhancing the value and reputation of Argentine resources.

- **Transparent Public Procurement**: Create a system that uses ZKPs to verify that public contracts are awarded fairly and without corruption, while protecting the privacy of the bidders.

### Track 4: Secure & Verifiable Governance üó≥Ô∏è

**The Challenge**: Recent controversies around electronic voting pilots and digital participation platforms in Argentina have highlighted the need for more secure and trustworthy systems. How can we use ZK to enhance democratic processes?

- **End-to-End Verifiable E-Voting**: Develop a ZK-based electronic voting system that allows citizens to verify that their vote was cast and counted correctly, without revealing how they voted.

- **Anonymous Whistleblower Platform**: Build a secure platform that allows citizens to report corruption or misconduct without revealing their identity, using ZKPs to verify the authenticity of their claims.

- **Decentralized Community Polling ("Consulta Popular")**: Create a tool that enables local communities, cooperatives, or neighborhood councils to conduct secure and private polls on important issues, fostering greater civic engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Resources & Toolkits

To help you get started, we've compiled a list of beginner-friendly ZK toolkits and resources. We encourage you to explore their documentation and tutorials.

**Noir**: A Rust-based language for creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs. It's designed to be developer-friendly and is a great starting point for ZK development.
- [Noir Documentation](https://noir-lang.org/docs)
- [Awesome Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/awesome-noir)

**Circom & SnarkJS**: The most widely used language for writing ZK circuits. It has a large community and a rich ecosystem of tools.
- [Circom Documentation](https://docs.circom.io/)
- [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)

**zk-kit**: A set of libraries and utilities for building ZK applications, including semaphore for anonymous signaling.
